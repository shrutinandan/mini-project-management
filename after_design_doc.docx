Title: Customer Profile Management System – Design Document
Version: 2.0
Author: Architecture Team
Date: 15-Feb-2025

1. Introduction
The Customer Profile Management System (CPMS) is designed to store, manage,
and analyze customer profile information for internal and external applications.

2. Scope
The system will handle customer basic details such as name, email, phone number,
address, and date of birth.

3. Architecture Overview
The system follows a microservices-based architecture:
- Presentation Layer: React-based web application
- Application Layer: Python-based REST APIs deployed as microservices
- Data Layer: PostgreSQL database with read replicas

4. Authentication
The system uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT-based authentication.
Passwords are no longer stored by the system.

5. API Design
The following APIs are exposed:
- POST /customers
- GET /customers/{id}
- PUT /customers/{id}
- DELETE /customers/{id}

6. Error Handling
All API errors return standard HTTP status codes along with
a structured error response body.

7. Logging and Monitoring
The system includes centralized logging and monitoring using Prometheus
and Grafana.

8. Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time should be less than 1 second.
- System availability should be 99.9%.
