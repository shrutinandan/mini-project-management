1. Introduction
The Customer Profile Management System (CPMS) is designed to store and manage
customer profile information for internal applications.

2. Scope
The system will handle customer basic details such as name, email, phone number,
and address.

3. Architecture Overview
The system follows a three-tier architecture:
- Presentation Layer: React-based web application
- Application Layer: Python-based REST APIs
- Data Layer: PostgreSQL database

4. Authentication
The system uses username and password-based authentication.
Passwords are stored using SHA-256 hashing.

5. API Design
The following APIs are exposed:
- POST /customers
- GET /customers/{id}
- PUT /customers/{id}

6. Error Handling
All API errors return standard HTTP status codes.

7. Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time should be less than 2 seconds.
- System availability should be 99.5%.
